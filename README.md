Previous coding experience, if any. At my old middle school we did a little bit of coding. Very basic stuff. I belive we coded in Java. I understand the topic of coding but I am not very sure how to do it. I'd consider myself a very beginner coder 
Reason(s) for taking this class. I always found technology really interesting. I also thought that having some basic knowledge of coding would be pretty beneficial for me. I also heard from some of my friends that they had a fun time in the class, so taking the class seemed like a really good choice for me.
Other interests (academic or otherwise). My favorite subjects are math and science. I like the challenge that comes with them and I also just find them very interesting. I also love to play lacrosse and cook. I also really enjoy music and movies. I guess all forms of media for that matter.
Goals you have for this class and/or projects you'd like to complete. My main goal is to become a capable coder. I want to be able to code stuff on my own and know what I'm doing. Another one of my goals is too see an increase in the complexity of my code throughout the year. I want to see growth in myself. One project I'd like to complete is to create a game of some sort.
